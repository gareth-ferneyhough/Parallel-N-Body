A sequential (no MPI) and parallel (Boost.MPI) version are included. 
Additionally, a file containing 25 bodies in the solar system are included
in order to set up initial conditions for a solar system simulation. A Matlab 
plotting program is provided for visualization. Both the plotter, and the 
solar system data were obtained from:
